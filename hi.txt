Read data from the file <name> in the current working directory for the user issuing the request and return the first hundred characters in it. Each subsequent call by the same client is to return the next hundred characters in the file, up until all characters are read. If a file with the specified <name> does not exist in the current working directory for the user, the request is to be denied with a proper message highlighting the error for the user. 	A service request without a <name> variable should close the currently opened file from reading. Subsequent calls with this file as <name> should start reading from the beginning of the file.
write_file <name> <input>	Write the data in <input> to the end of the file <name> in the current working directory for the user issuing the request, starting on a new line.  If no file exists with the given <name>, a new file is to be created in the current working directory for the user.	If <input> is empty, then the specified file is to be cleared of content.
create_folder <name>	Create a new folder with the specified <name> in the current working directory for the user issuing the request. If a folder with the given name already exists, the request is to be denied with a proper message highlighting the error for the user. 	-
register <username> <password> <privileges>	Register a new user with the <privileges> to the server using the <username> and <password> provided. If a user is already registered with the provided <username>, the request is to be denied with a proper message highlighting the error for the user. A new personal folder named <username> should be created on the server. The <privileges> should be either user or admin.	-
login <username> <password>	Log in the user conforming with <username> onto the server if the <password> provided matches the password used while registering. If the <password> does not match or if the <username> does not exist, an error message should be returned to the request for the client to present to the user.	-
delete <username> <password>	Delete the user conforming with <username> from the server. This service is only available to users with a privilege level of admin, and <password> is to be the password of the admin currently logged in.
